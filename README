6-Jan-2015	I envision having multiple projects for each backing technology
			ngrams-mysql-*
			ngrams-hbase-*
			ngrams-redis-*
			etc

			there should also be hte ability to pipeline projects
			for example:
				ngrams-redis-* => ngrams-hbase-*
			so that n-grams created with the aid of a redis cache
				can be stored within hbase, as an example

			common code should be promoted and reused where possible
			however, the idea is to avoid all forms of tight-coupling
			and to maintain multiple ways and technologies for n-gram creation

			should also emphasize the ability to filter everything 6 ways from sunday
			using pipeline design patterns and mda-dictionaries built in the data project 
			and existing in the commons project ...
